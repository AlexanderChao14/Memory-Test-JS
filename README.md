# The Emoji Button

This is a game in which you must use the button to help Alex improve his memory and cognitive abilities. By pressing the start button, emojis will fly across the screen and you have to keep track of how many emojis you have seen. Once all the emojis have crossed the screen, you will be asked to count the number of times a certain emoji appeared using the red _count emoji_ button before the timer runs outs.

For Example, if üê∂ appeared twice, then you would click the _count emoji_ button two times. Once the timer runs out, you will be informed if your answer was correct or not. Make sure to be careful when using the count button, as you can only count upwards!

If you answered correctly, you will progress to the next round which will have more emojis flying at a faster speed.

We hope you enjoy helping our friend Alex as much as we enjoyed making this for him!
